# Who am I?

I'm just a 19-year old student, i've just started learing coding.

# Which languages Am I interested in?
* C - that's not my most likeable language, I dont really recommending it for anyone.
* Python - this one is for sure more user-friendly, really easy to ride a code in.

# What are my goals?
First is of course to become a successful programmer, the second one is to have fun in my future job!
