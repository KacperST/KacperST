# Who am I?

I'm just a 19-year old student, i've just started learing coding.

# Which languages Am I interested in?
* C - that's not my most likeable language, I dont really recommending it for anyone.
* Python - this one is for sure more user-friendly, really easy to ride a code in.

# What are my goals?
First is of course to become a successful programmer, the second one is to have fun in my future job!

# My part in Pycharrming project
I've been told to do a "guess the number" and I did it. I had some problems but everything seems to work well now. I made 3 versions of the game, each version better than the previous one. In the final form of the game we can choose the range of numbers, we see how many shots we have and how close we are to the number bot thought of.
