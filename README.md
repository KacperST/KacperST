From the young age I used to participate in many math competitions and take high place in mostly of them ( For example laureate in Diamond Index of AGH or Math Curatorial Competition. Now I'm on my way to transfer my math sklls to programming skills.

# Algorithms
I want to write fast and efficient code. That's why I learn about data structures and algorithms. I'm training my skills on Leetcode. Even if my program there is not the fastest, I love to read other's code to see how I could have improved my program. I find it really helpful
