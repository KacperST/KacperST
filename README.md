# Who am I?

I'm just a 22-year old student who started programming 2 years ago. By the end of July I will have finished my 3rd year at Computer Science and Intelligent Systems on AGH University of Computer in Cracow. I've always been math-enjoyer and solving puzzles always have been my cup  of tea. From the young age I used to participate in many math competitions and take high place in mostly of them (ex. laureate in Diamond Index of AGH or Math Curatorial Competition). Now I'm on my way to transfer my math sklls to programming skills. Recently, I've got very fascinated about Machine Learning, especiialy Deep learning, Generative Adversial Networks and Natural Language Processing.

# What technologies Am I most interested in?
* Python - Pandas, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, PyTorch, Numpy FastAPi
* PostgreSQL, MongoDB
* JavaScript, TypeScript, React, React Native

# What are my goals?
My goal is to use my analytical skills to develop advanced machine learning programs, create deep learning models and work with big data.

# Projects

## FakÃ©mon
Deep Learning model that me and my 2 friends are currently
working on. The goal is to generate images of new Pokemonsâ€™ species
using GAN ( DCGAN, StyleGAN and StyleSwin ).
Implemented in Python using Pytorch.

## SafePlant
A mobile app for monitoring soilâ€™s humidity and room temperature.
Data are gathered from sensors connected with ESP-32 and stored on
a server. The project was done in a 3-person team and my job was to
build an entire mobile app with React Native.

## WildLife Simulation

A web app simulating life in forest of foxes and hares based on
Agent Based Modelling. Implemented in Python using Mesa
framework and Numpy.

## Travel agency web app
A web application that could be used by travel agencies. 
It offers simple CRUD operations for user and views of trips, history and shopping cart. 
Built with React ( in TypeScript ) and Express.js.

## Quizly App ðŸ“±

A mobile app for playing offline & online quizzes and creating your own. It was  built using Flutter, Python, Firebase Authorization and Databases by me and 3 friends. My responsibilities included creating the layout, connecting the app to Firebase Authorization and handling the API's requests.
Here's how it looks:

## Converter from Kotlin code to C++ code
Application with really basic Text Editior in which your Kotlin Code (imported or written) may be converted into c++ code. Wrote with Python and ANTLR4

## Zombie game:

Simple FPS game to kill zombies, built in Java

## Future goals 
If I get some extra money I'd like to buy a new GPU deliberately to create neural networks models and take part in Kaggle competitions for gaining some experience.
