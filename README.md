# Who am I?

I'm just a 22-year old student who started programming 2 years ago. By the end of July I will have finished my 3rd year at Computer Science and Intelligent Systems on AGH University of Computer in Cracow. I've always been math-enjoyer and solving puzzles always have been my cup  of tea. From the young age I used to participate in many math competitions and take high place in mostly of them ( For example laureate in Diamond Index of AGH or Math Curatorial Competition). Now I'm on my way to transfer my math sklls to programming skills.

# What technologies Am I most interested in?
* Python - Pandas, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, PyTorch,, Numpy FastAPi
* PostgreSQL, MongoDB
* JavaScript, TypeScript, React, React Native

# What are my goals?
My goal is to use my analytical skills to develop advanced machine learning programs, create deep learning models and work with big data.
